## 🤖 For AI Assistants

**READ THIS FIRST**: Before working on this codebase, read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for mandatory workflow requirements:
- ✅ ALWAYS lint code after creating/modifying it (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ ALWAYS run tests after creating/modifying tests (`npm test`)
- ✅ ALWAYS proactively communicate "what's left" - don't wait to be asked
- ❌ NEVER include `node_modules/`, `coverage/`, or build artifacts
- ❌ NEVER create files without linting and testing them

This ensures high-quality contributions that match Expedia Group engineering standards.

## Evolutionary Prompt Optimization

**⚠️ This repository is the authoritative source for evolutionary prompt optimization methodology.**

We've developed tooling for optimizing LLM prompts through evolutionary testing:

- **+31.1% quality improvement** in 20 rounds (proven with data)
- **Objective scoring** with keep/discard logic (no subjective judgment)
- **Proven mutation library** (Top 5 mutations deliver 71-73% of improvement)
- **Out-of-the-box tooling** ready for Genesis-spawned projects

### For Genesis Integration

**Use:** [`PROMPT-FOR-GENESIS-EVOLUTIONARY-INTEGRATION.md`](PROMPT-FOR-GENESIS-EVOLUTIONARY-INTEGRATION.md) (1,063 lines)

This comprehensive prompt guides Claude in the Genesis repository to:
- ✅ **COPY** existing tools (don't recreate 526 lines of battle-tested code)
- ✅ Integrate optimization into all spawned projects
- ✅ Create project-type-specific scorers (PRD, one-pager, COE)
- ✅ Enable cross-project quality comparison

### For Other Projects

See [`docs/cross-project-prompts/`](docs/cross-project-prompts/) for integration guides:
- One-pager integration
- Legacy Genesis prompts (reference only)

### Key Files

- `tools/evolutionary-optimizer.js` - Core optimization engine (526 lines)
- `tools/prd-scorer.js` - Objective PRD quality scorer
- `tools/run-simulations.sh` - Batch simulation executor
- `evolutionary-optimization/` - Test cases, results, documentation
- `docs/continuous-improvement/SIMULATION-RESULTS-SUMMARY.md` - Complete analysis

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Go REST API on port 8080
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web UI on port 8501 (desktop) / Vanilla JS (web)
- **Storage**: Local filesystem (desktop) / IndexedDB (web)

## Download

### Web App (Recommended)
**🌐 [Launch Web App](https://bordenet.github.io/product-requirements-assistant/)**

No download required! Works on any device with a modern browser.

## Configuration

**Prompt Templates**: Edit in UI or directly in `prompts/` directory

**Validation Limits**:
- Title: 200 characters
- Problems/Description: 100KB
- Context: 50KB
- PRD Content: 200KB
- Max Request Size: 10MB

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
```bash
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:8501 | xargs kill -9
```

Or just run the setup script again - it will handle this automatically.

**Logs:**
```bash
tail -f backend.log frontend.log
```

See [`docs/development/LOGGING.md`](docs/development/LOGGING.md) for detailed error documentation.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test-all

# Backend tests only
make test-backend

# Integration tests
make test-integration

# Comprehensive validation (recommended before commits)
./scripts/validate-monorepo.sh --quick   # ~1-2 minutes (Unix/Linux/macOS)
./scripts/validate-monorepo.sh --full    # ~3-5 minutes (Unix/Linux/macOS)

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\validate-monorepo.ps1 -Quick   # ~1-2 minutes
.\scripts\validate-monorepo.ps1 -Full    # ~3-5 minutes
```

**Validation includes:**
- Dependency checks (Go, Python versions)
- Project structure validation
- Backend build and linting (go vet, gofmt)
- Backend tests (all test suites)
- Frontend linting (flake8, black)
- Security scanning (secret detection) - full mode only
- Git status check - full mode only

### Mock AI for Automated Testing

For automated testing without manual copy/paste, enable Mock AI:

```bash
export MOCK_AI_ENABLED=true
cd backend && go run .
```

Then use the generate endpoint to auto-complete phases:

```bash
# Generate Phase 1 response
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/projects/{project_id}/generate/1

# Generate Phase 2 response
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/projects/{project_id}/generate/2

# Generate Phase 3 response
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/projects/{project_id}/generate/3
```

Note: Mock AI is for testing/development only. See [`docs/development/MOCK_AI.md`](docs/development/MOCK_AI.md) for details.

## Quality Gates

This repository includes automated safety mechanisms:

Pre-Commit Hooks (prevents broken commits):
```bash
# Install hooks (one-time setup)
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

The hooks will automatically:
- Block compiled binaries from being committed
- Scan for secrets and credentials
- Ensure code quality before commits

Validation System:
```bash
# Quick validation (dependencies, builds, tests)
./scripts/validate-monorepo.sh --quick

# Full validation (includes security scans)
./scripts/validate-monorepo.sh --full
```

To bypass hooks in emergencies:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"
```
Note: Only use `--no-verify` when absolutely necessary.

## Known Limitations

- No direct API integration (requires manual copy/paste)
- Single user only
- Local storage only
- No real-time collaboration

- Limited to text-based PRDs

## Future Work

### Planned Improvements (v1.6+)

**Library-Based Architecture**:
- Refactor core business logic into `internal/core/` package
- Enable thick clients to run workflows in-process (no HTTP backend required)
- Reduce memory footprint and startup time for desktop applications
- See [`internal/README.md`](internal/README.md) for details

**Enhanced Testing**:
- Property-based testing for validation logic
- Fuzzing for input sanitization
- Performance benchmarks for file operations
- Cross-client end-to-end test matrix

**Developer Experience**:
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification for REST API
- GraphQL endpoint for flexible queries
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Plugin system for custom AI providers

**Deployment Options**:
- Docker Compose for containerized deployment
- Kubernetes manifests for cloud deployment
- Terraform modules for infrastructure as code
- CI/CD templates for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins

**User Features**:
- Version history and diff visualization
- Export to PDF, DOCX, Confluence
- Template library for common PRD types
- Collaborative editing with conflict resolution
