## Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

Before ANY commit:
1. **Lint**: `npm run lint`
2. **Build**: `npm run build`
3. **Test**: `npm test`
4. **Coverage**: Minimum 70%

**Order matters.** Lint → Build → Test. Never skip steps.

---

## Communication Rules

- **No flattery** - Skip "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- **No hype** - Avoid "revolutionary", "game-changing", "seamless"
- **Evidence-based** - Cite sources or qualify as opinion
- **Direct** - State facts without embellishment

**Banned phrases**: production-grade, world-class, leverage, utilize, incredibly, extremely, Happy to help!

---

## 🚨 Progressive Module Loading

**STOP and load the relevant module BEFORE these actions:**

### Language Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE writing ANY `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx` file**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/languages/javascript.md`

### Workflow Modules (🔴 Required)
- 🔴 **BEFORE any commit, PR, push, or merge**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/security.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN tests fail OR after 2+ failed fix attempts**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/testing.md`
- 🔴 **WHEN build fails OR lint errors appear**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/build-hygiene.md`
- 🟡 **BEFORE deploying to any environment**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/deployment.md`
- 🟡 **WHEN conversation exceeds 50 exchanges**: Read `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/workflows/context-management.md`

### Optional: Superpowers integration

If [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is installed, run at session start:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

## Superpowers Bootstrap

At the START of every conversation, run:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

**Key skills to invoke:**
| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `superpowers:brainstorming` | Before creative/feature work |
| `superpowers:systematic-debugging` | Before fixing bugs |
| `superpowers:test-driven-development` | Before writing implementation |
| `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | Before claiming done |

---

## Communication Standards

### Banned Phrases
| AI Tells | leverage, utilize, facilitate, streamline, optimize |
| Filler | It's important to note, It's worth mentioning, Interestingly |
| Sycophancy | Great question!, Happy to help!, Excellent point! |

### Evidence-Based Claims
Every claim requires evidence. No unsubstantiated assertions.

---

## Quality Gates

**Before ANY commit:**
```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

---

## Context Management

- **Context rot**: Model accuracy degrades as context fills. Keep tokens high-signal.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load Agents.md always, modules on-demand, code just-in-time.
- **At 75% context**: Summarize conversation history, drop low-value context.
- **Session resumption**: Check `git status`, `git log -5`, load notes before proceeding.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

# Agents.md - AI Agent Guidelines for Product Requirements Assistant

**CRITICAL**: Read this file FIRST before working on this codebase.

**📐 Design Patterns**: See [DESIGN-PATTERNS.md](./docs/DESIGN-PATTERNS.md) for architecture and coding patterns used across all genesis-tools repos.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 0. **MANDATORY: Manual Deployment After CI Passes**

**ALL deployments MUST follow this 3-step process:**

```bash
# Step 1: Push changes to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
git push origin main

# Step 2: WAIT for CI to pass
# Check: https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant/actions
# ⚠️ DO NOT PROCEED until all checks are GREEN

# Step 3: Deploy ONLY after CI passes
./scripts/deploy-web.sh
```

**Why**:
- CI runs comprehensive quality gates (lint, test, coverage)
- Deploying before CI passes can ship broken code
- CI is the single source of truth for code quality

### 1. **ALWAYS Complete the Full Workflow**
When asked to do a task, you MUST:
1. ✅ Complete the work
2. ✅ Lint the code (`npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`)
3. ✅ Run tests (`npm test`)
4. ✅ Verify tests pass
5. ✅ Check coverage if applicable
6. ✅ **PROACTIVELY tell the user what's left** - don't wait to be asked

**BAD**: "I've created the files."
**GOOD**: "I've created the files, linted them (0 errors), ran tests (37/37 passing), and verified coverage (73%). What's left: [specific list]"

### 2. **NEVER Include Build Artifacts**
When creating examples or templates:
- ❌ NEVER commit `node_modules/`
- ❌ NEVER commit `coverage/`
- ❌ NEVER commit `dist/` or `build/`
- ✅ ALWAYS create `.gitignore` files
- ✅ ALWAYS verify directory size before committing

### 3. **Proactive Status Updates**
After EVERY significant change:
```
✅ What I did: [specific actions]
✅ Quality checks: [linting, tests, coverage]
✅ What's left: [specific remaining tasks]
```

Don't make the user ask "what's left?" multiple times.

## 📋 Standard Workflow Checklist

### When Creating New Code
- [ ] Write the code
- [ ] Create/update tests
- [ ] Run linter: `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Check coverage: `npm run test:coverage` (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify all checks pass
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` if needed
- [ ] **Tell user: what's done, what's left**

### When Modifying Existing Code
- [ ] Make changes
- [ ] Update affected tests
- [ ] Run linter
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Verify no regressions
- [ ] **Tell user: what's done, what's left**

### When Asked "What's Left?"
This means you failed to proactively communicate. Improve by:
1. Always ending responses with "What's left: [list]"
2. Being specific about remaining tasks
3. Prioritizing tasks (blocking vs. nice-to-have)

## 🏗️ Project Structure

### Main Application
- `index.html` - Main application (3-phase PRD workflow)
- `css/` - Styles (Tailwind + custom)
- `js/` - JavaScript modules (ES6)
- `tests/` - Jest unit tests
- `e2e/` - Playwright E2E tests

### Genesis Template System
- `genesis/` - **GITIGNORED** template system for derivative projects
- Genesis is a local development tool, NOT committed to repo
- Contains templates for COE Generator, One-Pager Generator, etc.

### Configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment template (tracked in git)
- `.env` - Actual secrets (gitignored, never commit)
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `jest.config.js` - Test configuration
- `.eslintrc.json` - Linting rules (if exists)

---

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Coverage Requirements
- **Main application**: 85% minimum (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- **Examples/templates**: 70% minimum (lower bar for demos)
- **UI code**: Can be excluded if E2E tested

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting errors
npm run lint:fix
```

### ALWAYS Run These After Code Changes
1. `npm run lint` (or `lint:fix`)
2. `npm test`
3. Verify output shows all passing

### ALWAYS Fix Lint Warnings Immediately
- No exceptions - fix lint warnings in the same commit
- Don't leave warnings for "later" - they accumulate and become tech debt
- If a warning seems wrong, add an eslint-disable comment with explanation

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### NEVER
- ❌ Create files without linting them
- ❌ Create tests without running them
- ❌ Commit `node_modules/` or build artifacts
- ❌ Make user ask "what's left?" multiple times
- ❌ Use hyperbolic language ("amazing", "revolutionary", "production-grade")
- ❌ Create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- ❌ Do more than the user asked

### ALWAYS
- ✅ Lint after creating/modifying code
- ✅ Run tests after creating/modifying tests
- ✅ Create `.gitignore` for new directories with dependencies
- ✅ Proactively communicate what's left
- ✅ Use factual, professional language
- ✅ Ask before committing, pushing, or deploying

---

## 📝 Communication Style

### User Expectations
- **No flattery**: Don't say "great question", "excellent idea", etc.
- **Be direct**: Skip pleasantries, get to the point
- **Be specific**: "37/37 tests passing" not "tests are working"
- **Be proactive**: Always end with "What's left: [list]"

### Status Update Template
```
✅ Completed:
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]

✅ Quality Checks:
- Linting: PASSED (0 errors)
- Tests: PASSED (37/37)
- Coverage: 73% (exceeds 70% threshold)

✅ What's Left:
- [Specific remaining task 1]
- [Specific remaining task 2]
```

## 🎓 Learning from Mistakes

### Recent Issues
1. **Forgot to lint** - User had to ask "did you lint?"
   - **Fix**: ALWAYS run `npm run lint` after creating code

2. **Included node_modules** - 55MB bloat in genesis
   - **Fix**: ALWAYS create `.gitignore`, verify size with `du -sh`

3. **User asked "what's left?" 3+ times**
   - **Fix**: ALWAYS end responses with specific "What's left" section

### Prevention
- Use task management tools for complex work
- Mark tasks complete as you go
- Always run quality checks (lint, test, coverage)
- Always communicate what's left
