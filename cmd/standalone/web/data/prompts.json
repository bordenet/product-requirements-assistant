Again, don't provide any code or JSON schema or SQL queries, ever. You will help me review a product requirements document (PRD), attached, generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5 and help distill it / simplify it / tease critical details out so that we hand a more mature, less ambiguous document to the engineering team.\n\nPlease be sure to add section numbering for ## and ### levels of the resulting markdown.

Work with me to compare Gemini's version of the doc with yours and determine where we can make things cleaner/simpler/better. Identify areas of conflict and/or contradiction so we can create a successor version of the document which I can safely share with the engineering team.\n\nInclude section numbers, as we did last time. Please DO NOT include a metadata table on top of the document (author, version, date, etc...)\n\nHere are both versions:\n\nORIGINAL CLAUDE VERSION:\n[PASTE CLAUDE'S ORIGINAL PRD HERE]\n\nGEMINI REVIEW VERSION:\n[PASTE GEMINI'S PRD RENDITION HERE]\n\nAt the end of the final PRD, please include this citation:\n\n---\n*This PRD was generated using the Product Requirements Assistant tool.
