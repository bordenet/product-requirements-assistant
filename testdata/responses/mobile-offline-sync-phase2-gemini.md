# Mobile Offline Data Synchronization - Streamlined Requirements

## 1. Project Foundation

This document refines the mobile offline synchronization requirements to focus on essential deliverables and clear engineering specifications for implementing robust offline capabilities in our React Native application.

## 2. Core Problem and Solution

### 2.1 Primary Challenge
Users lose work and cannot use the application effectively when internet connectivity is poor or unavailable, particularly impacting field workers and users in connectivity-challenged environments.

### 2.2 Solution Overview
Implement a comprehensive offline-first architecture with intelligent data synchronization, conflict resolution, and seamless online/offline transitions.

## 3. Measurable Success Criteria

### 3.1 Critical Metrics (6-month targets)
- **Data Loss Prevention**: <0.1% of offline work sessions result in data loss
- **User Retention**: 40% improvement in retention for users in low-connectivity areas  
- **Offline Adoption**: 60% of users actively use offline features monthly
- **Sync Reliability**: 99.5% successful synchronization completion rate

### 3.2 Performance Benchmarks
- **Sync Speed**: Complete data synchronization within 30 seconds for average dataset
- **Storage Impact**: Offline data consumption under 500MB per user
- **Battery Efficiency**: Less than 5% additional battery drain from offline features
- **App Performance**: No measurable impact on app responsiveness during sync operations

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Data Storage Layer
- **Primary Storage**: SQLite with AES-256 encryption for all offline data
- **File Management**: Secure local file system for media (photos, documents)
- **Cache Strategy**: Intelligent caching based on usage patterns and data priority
- **Storage Limits**: User-configurable limits with automatic cleanup of old data

### 4.2 Synchronization Engine
- **Connectivity Monitoring**: Real-time network status detection and response
- **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connectivity restored
- **Delta Sync**: Only transmit changes since last successful sync
- **Priority Queuing**: Critical data synchronized first, followed by media files

### 4.3 Conflict Resolution System
- **Detection Method**: Server timestamp comparison with client-side versioning
- **Resolution Strategies**: 
  - Automatic: Last-writer-wins for non-critical fields
  - Manual: User-guided resolution for important data conflicts
  - Intelligent merging: Field-level conflict resolution where possible

## 5. User Experience Design
