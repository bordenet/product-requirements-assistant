# AI Chat Widget Integration - Refined Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

This document presents a refined version of the AI Chat Widget requirements, focusing on clarity and actionable deliverables for the engineering team.

## 2. Core Problem and Solution

### 2.1 Primary Problem
Users need immediate assistance while using our web application, but current support channels create friction and delays.

### 2.2 Solution Approach
Implement a lightweight, contextually-aware chat widget that provides instant answers and seamlessly escalates complex queries to human support.

## 3. Measurable Outcomes

### 3.1 Success Criteria (6-month targets)
- **Ticket Reduction**: 30% decrease in Tier 1 support tickets
- **User Adoption**: 40% monthly active widget usage
- **Resolution Efficiency**: 70% of interactions resolve without human intervention
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second response times maintained

### 3.2 Key Performance Indicators
- Widget engagement rate per session
- Query resolution success rate
- User satisfaction rating (post-interaction survey)
- Support team workload metrics

## 4. User Experience Requirements

### 4.1 Widget Interface
- **Positioning**: Fixed bottom-right corner with 24px margins
- **States**: Minimized (notification badge), expanded (chat interface), hidden (user preference)
- **Visual Design**: Consistent with existing design system, branded colors
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, keyboard navigable

### 4.2 Interaction Flow
1. User encounters question or confusion
2. Widget suggests relevant help based on current page
3. User types natural language query
4. AI provides structured response with relevant links
5. User can rate response or request human assistance

## 5. Technical Implementation

### 5.1 Architecture Requirements
- **Frontend**: React component integrated with existing bundle
- **Backend**: RESTful API for query processing
- **AI Service**: External service integration with fallback responses
- **Data Storage**: Session-based conversation history

### 5.2 Performance Specifications
- **Bundle Impact**: Maximum 50KB increase to main bundle
- **Load Time**: Widget ready within 500ms of page load
- **Response Time**: 95% of queries respond within 3 seconds
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when AI service unavailable

## 6. Content and Intelligence

### 6.1 Knowledge Base
- Existing documentation and FAQ content
- Feature-specific help content based on current page
- Common user task flows and troubleshooting steps
- Error message explanations and solutions

### 6.2 Context Awareness
- Current page/section identification
- User role and permission level
- Previous widget interactions within session
- Feature usage patterns (if available)
