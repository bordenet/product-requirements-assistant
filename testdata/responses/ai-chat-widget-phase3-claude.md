- 99.5% widget availability uptime

## 4. User Experience Specification

### 4.1 Widget Interface Design
- **Position**: Fixed bottom-right with 24px margins from edges
- **Visual States**: 
  - Minimized: Branded button with notification badge
  - Expanded: Chat interface (320px width, max 480px height)
  - Hidden: User-controlled visibility preference
- **Design Compliance**: Full integration with existing design system
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, keyboard navigation support

### 4.2 User Interaction Flow
1. **Discovery**: Widget suggests help based on current page context
2. **Engagement**: User initiates conversation via click or contextual prompt
3. **Query**: Natural language input with smart suggestions
4. **Response**: Structured AI response with formatting and relevant links
5. **Resolution**: User feedback or escalation to human support if needed
