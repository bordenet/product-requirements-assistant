# AI Chat Widget Integration

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an AI-powered chat widget to reduce support ticket volume and improve user experience on our web application. The widget will provide instant, contextual assistance to users without requiring them to leave their current workflow.

## 2. Business Context and Objectives

### 2.1 Problem Statement
- High volume of repetitive support tickets consuming team resources
- Users struggle to find relevant information in existing documentation
- Lack of real-time assistance leads to user frustration and potential churn
- Support team overwhelmed with questions that could be automated

### 2.2 Business Goals
- Reduce support ticket volume by 30% within 6 months
- Improve user satisfaction scores by 25%
- Decrease time-to-resolution for common user queries
- Enable support team to focus on complex, high-value interactions

## 3. Success Metrics

### 3.1 Primary Metrics
- Support ticket reduction: 30% decrease in repetitive queries
- User engagement: 40% of users interact with widget within first month
- Resolution rate: 70% of widget interactions resolve without escalation
- Response time: Average query response under 3 seconds

### 3.2 Secondary Metrics
- User satisfaction score improvement
- Page performance impact (< 100ms load time increase)
- Widget abandonment rate (< 20%)
- Cost savings from reduced support workload

## 4. User Requirements

### 4.1 Primary Users
- Existing web application users seeking help with features
- New users onboarding to the platform
- Support team members monitoring widget performance

### 4.2 User Stories
- As a user, I want instant answers to common questions without leaving my current page
- As a user, I want the chat widget to understand context of what I'm currently viewing
- As a support agent, I want to see which queries the widget couldn't resolve
- As a product manager, I want analytics on what users are asking about most

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Core Features
- **Persistent Chat Interface**: Always-accessible widget in bottom-right corner
- **Contextual Responses**: AI understands current page/feature user is viewing
- **Query Processing**: Natural language processing for user questions
- **Escalation Path**: Seamless handoff to human support when needed
- **Search Integration**: Widget can search existing documentation
- **Response Formatting**: Rich text responses with links and formatting

### 5.2 Widget Behavior
- Minimized state by default with notification badge
- Expandable interface showing conversation history
- Smart suggestions based on current page context
- Typing indicators and response acknowledgments

## 6. Technical Requirements

### 6.1 Integration Constraints
- Must integrate with existing React-based web application
- Compatible with current design system and theming
- No impact on existing page functionality or layout
- Lightweight implementation (< 50KB additional bundle size)

### 6.2 Performance Requirements
- Initial widget load time < 500ms
- Query response time < 3 seconds average
- No impact on page load performance
- Graceful degradation when AI service unavailable

### 6.3 Data Requirements
- Access to documentation content for search
- User context (current page, user role, feature usage)
- Conversation history storage (session-based)
- Analytics data collection for continuous improvement

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Scalability
- Support concurrent usage by all active users
- Handle query volume spikes during peak hours
- Horizontal scaling capability for AI processing

### 7.2 Reliability
- 99.5% uptime for widget availability
- Fallback behavior when AI service unavailable
- Error recovery and user feedback for failures

### 7.3 Security
- No storage of sensitive user information in queries
- Encrypted communication between widget and AI service
- Audit trail for escalated conversations

## 8. Implementation Phases

### 8.1 Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic chat widget interface
- Simple FAQ-style responses
- Manual escalation to support
- Basic analytics tracking

### 8.2 Phase 2
- Contextual awareness implementation
- Advanced AI response generation
- Automated escalation triggers
- Enhanced analytics dashboard

### 8.3 Phase 3
- Personalized responses based on user history
- Multi-language support
- Advanced conversation flows
- Integration with CRM system

## 9. Dependencies and Assumptions

### 9.1 Dependencies
- AI/ML service for natural language processing
- Documentation content management system
- Analytics platform for data collection
- Design system components for UI consistency

### 9.2 Assumptions
- Users prefer self-service options when effective
- Current documentation covers most common queries
- AI service can provide acceptable response quality
- Engineering team has React expertise for implementation

## 10. Risks and Mitigation

### 10.1 Technical Risks
- AI response quality below user expectations
- Performance impact on existing application
- Integration complexity with legacy systems

### 10.2 Mitigation Strategies
- Thorough AI training with domain-specific content
- Performance testing at each development milestone
- Phased rollout with feature flags for quick rollback
