# Bug Fix: Large PRD Input Validation Error

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Issue**: Backend returning 400 error when creating projects with large PRD descriptions
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem

When users attempted to create a new PRD project with a large "Problems to Address" input (e.g., a comprehensive existing PRD of 20,000+ characters), the backend rejected the request with a `400 Bad Request` error.

### Error Symptoms

- **Frontend UI**: Error message when submitting project creation form
- **Backend Log**: `POST /api/projects 400`
- **Root Cause**: Validation limit in `backend/validation.go` was set to only 5,000 characters for the problems field

### Impact

Users could not use the tool with existing comprehensive PRDs as input, significantly limiting the tool's usefulness for iterating on existing documentation.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Code Location: `backend/validation.go:59`

**Original Code:**
```go
return &InputValidator{
    maxTitleLength:    200,
    maxProblemsLength: 5000,    // ← TOO SMALL
    maxContextLength:  5000,     // ← TOO SMALL
    maxContentLength:  100000,
    // ...
}
```

**Validation Error:**
```go
func (v *InputValidator) ValidateCreateProjectRequest(req *CreateProjectRequest) error {
    // ...
    if len(req.Problems) > v.maxProblemsLength {
        return fmt.Errorf("problems description must be less than %d characters", v.maxProblemsLength)
    }
    // ...
}
```

The `maxProblemsLength` of 5,000 characters was insufficient for:
- Comprehensive PRD documents
- Detailed technical specifications
- Multiple user stories and requirements
- Large context descriptions

---

## Solution

### Changes Made

**File**: `backend/validation.go:57-64`

**Updated Code:**
```go
return &InputValidator{
    maxTitleLength:    200,
    maxProblemsLength: 100000, // Increased from 5,000 to 100,000 (100KB)
    maxContextLength:  50000,  // Increased from 5,000 to 50,000 (50KB)
    maxContentLength:  200000, // Increased from 100,000 to 200,000 (200KB)
    forbiddenPatterns: forbiddenPatterns,
    allowedHTMLTags:   allowedTags,
}
```

### New Limits

| Field | Old Limit | New Limit | Description |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Title | 200 chars | 200 chars | Unchanged - sufficient for titles |
| Problems | 5,000 chars | 100,000 chars (~100KB) | Can now handle large PRDs |
| Context | 5,000 chars | 50,000 chars (~50KB) | Additional context field |
| Content | 100,000 chars | 200,000 chars (~200KB) | Phase content |
| HTTP Request | 10MB | 10MB | Unchanged - more than sufficient |

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Medium PRD Input (~3.5KB)
```bash
✅ SUCCESS: 3,430 characters accepted
Project ID: 0534ccf6-7c98-4900-93a8-9bac6e4e26db
```

### Test Case 2: Large PRD Input (~20KB)
```bash
✅ SUCCESS: 20,549 characters accepted
Project ID: 27de1e4f-4baf-42b0-9342-eaa77b6d696b
```

### Backend Log Confirmation
```
2025/10/17 22:50:02 POST /api/projects 200 1.102458ms
2025/10/17 22:50:16 POST /api/projects 200 1.134166ms
```

Both requests succeeded with `200 OK` status.

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
✅ Users can now paste comprehensive existing PRDs
✅ Supports detailed technical specifications
✅ No need to split content across multiple fields
✅ Better user experience for complex projects

### Risk Assessment
🟢 **Low Risk**:
- Limits are still well within HTTP request size (10MB)
- Validation and sanitization still applied
- Security patterns still checked
- No breaking changes to API

### Performance Considerations
- Larger payloads may increase:
  - Network transfer time (minimal - 100KB is small)
  - JSON parsing time (negligible)
  - Database storage (file-based, plenty of space)
- **Conclusion**: No significant performance impact

---

## Deployment

### Steps to Apply Fix

1. **Backend code updated** in `backend/validation.go`
2. **Backend restart required**:
   ```bash
   # Kill existing backend
   lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9

   # Start updated backend
   make run-backend
   ```
3. **No frontend changes needed**
4. **No database migration needed** (file-based storage)

### Verification

After deployment, verify with:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","problems":"<20KB+ content>","context":"Test"}'
```

Expected: `200 OK` with project ID

## Documentation Updates

Updated files:
- ✅ `backend/validation.go` - Increased limits
- ✅ `LOGGING.md` - Documented new validation limits
- ✅ `BUGFIX_LARGE_INPUT.md` - This document

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Validation limits should match real-world use cases**: Initial 5KB limit was based on assumption of short descriptions, not comprehensive PRDs
2. **Better error messaging needed**: 400 errors should include which field failed validation and why
3. **Testing with realistic data**: Should test with actual large PRD examples during development
4. **Documentation**: Limits should be documented in user-facing docs

---

## Future Improvements

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Better Error Messages**:
   ```go
   return fmt.Errorf("problems description too large (%d chars). Maximum: %d chars",
       len(req.Problems), v.maxProblemsLength)
   ```

2. **Frontend Validation**:
   - Add character counter in UI
   - Warn users before submission if approaching limit
   - Show remaining characters

3. **Configurable Limits**:
   - Move limits to environment variables
   - Allow customization without code changes
   - Different limits for different environments

4. **Chunking Support** (if needed):
   - For extremely large inputs (>100KB)
   - Support multi-part uploads
   - Stream processing for very large files

---

## Conclusion

The bug has been successfully resolved. Users can now submit large PRD inputs (up to 100KB for problems field) without encountering validation errors. The fix has been tested, documented, and deployed with no negative impacts.

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
