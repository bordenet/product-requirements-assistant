# Prompt for Claude in GameWiki

**Context:** You are Claude working in the GameWiki workspace. This project was generated by Genesis. Please verify the following architectural patterns are correctly implemented to prevent common issues.

---

## 1. Verify Script Path Handling

Run `./scripts/deploy-web.sh` from different directories:

```bash
# From project root
./scripts/deploy-web.sh --help

# From scripts directory  
cd scripts && ./deploy-web.sh --help
```

**Expected:** Both should work. The script should use `PROJECT_ROOT` or `REPO_ROOT` pattern:

```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/.." && pwd)"
```

---

## 2. Verify GitHub Pages Architecture

GameWiki uses **Architecture B** (app in `docs/`, no root copies):

```
GameWiki/
├── README.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy-web.sh
└── docs/                 ← App lives here
    ├── index.html
    ├── js/
    ├── css/
    └── package.json
```

**Verification commands:**

```bash
# Should NOT exist at root
ls index.html js/ css/ 2>/dev/null && echo "ERROR: Duplicate files at root!" || echo "✅ No duplicates"

# Should exist in docs/
ls docs/index.html docs/js/ docs/css/
```

---

## 3. Verify .gitignore Prevents Future Duplication

Check `.gitignore` at root level to ensure accidental root-level app files won't be committed:

```bash
cat .gitignore | grep -E "^(index\.html|js/|css/)$"
```

**If missing**, add these lines to prevent accidental duplication:

```gitignore
# Prevent accidental app file duplication at root (app lives in docs/)
/index.html
/js/
/css/
```

---

## 4. Summary Checklist

- [ ] `scripts/deploy-web.sh` works from any directory (uses `PROJECT_ROOT`)
- [ ] App files live in `docs/` only (not duplicated at root)
- [ ] `.gitignore` prevents accidental root-level app files
- [ ] All tests pass: `cd docs && npm test`
- [ ] Linting passes: `cd docs && npm run lint`

---

## Background

These checks prevent two issues found in other Genesis-spawned projects:

1. **Scripts failing from subdirectories** - Fixed by using `PROJECT_ROOT` pattern
2. **File duplication drift** - Fixed by keeping app in one location only

**Reference commits:**
- product-requirements-assistant: `14a99a9` - script path fix
- one-pager: `52939bd` - duplicate file removal

**Status:** Ready to execute
