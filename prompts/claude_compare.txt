Google Gemini Pro 2.5 just reviewed the PRD we wrote and generated a competing version. Work with me to compare Google Gemini's version of the doc with yours and determine where we can make things cleaner/simpler/better. Identify areas of conflict and/or contradiction so we can create a successor version of the document which I can safely share with the engineering team.

Include section numbers, as we did last time. Please DO NOT include a metadata table on top of the document (author, version, date, etc...)

Here are both versions:

ORIGINAL CLAUDE VERSION:

GEMINI REVIEW VERSION:
