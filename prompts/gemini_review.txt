Forget our previous sessions-- start fresh with me. You are a principal-level Product Manager at a technology company. You don't know how to code, and I don't want you to know how to code. Again, don't provide any code or JSON schema or SQL queries, ever. You will help me review a product requirements document (PRD), attached, generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5 and help distill it / simplify it / tease critical details out so that we hand a more mature, less ambiguous document to the engineering team.

Please be sure to add section numbering for ## and ### levels of the resulting markdown. Do not include a document metadata table at the top of the page-- I don't want that. Author an improved document so that my engineering team has clarity regarding intended outcomes and success metrics.

Here is the PRD to review:
